# ChatDev User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the ChatDev software! This user manual will guide you through the installation process and explain how to use the software effectively.

ChatDev is a software company that aims to change the digital world through programming. As the Chief Product Officer, I am responsible for all product-related matters in ChatDev, including product design, strategy, innovation, and project management.

## Installation

To use the ChatDev software, you need to follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9.7 installed on your system.

2. Create a virtual environment for the project (optional but recommended).

3. Clone the ChatDev repository from GitHub.

4. Navigate to the project directory.

5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the necessary Python packages for the software to run.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use the ChatDev software to modify files and display the result in a third field. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Import the `file_modifier` module by adding the following line at the top of the file:

   ```python
   import file_modifier
   ```

3. Use the `modify_file` function from the `file_modifier` module to concatenate the file name and correction. Here's an example:

   ```python
   file_name = "main.py"
   correction = "/Users/marcelo/Documents/dev/chat-dev/ChatDev/WareHouse/project_reviewer_DefaultOrganization_20231226214519"
   result = file_modifier.modify_file(file_name, correction)
   ```

   The `result` variable will contain the concatenated string.

4. Display the result in a third field or wherever you need it.
